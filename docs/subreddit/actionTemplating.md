Actions that can submit text (Report, Comment, UserNote) will have their `content` values run through a [Mustache Template](https://mustache.github.io/). This means you can insert data generated by Rules into your text before the Action is performed.

See here for a [cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/FoxxMD/d365707cf99fdb526a504b8b833a5b78) and [here](https://www.tsmean.com/articles/mustache/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/) for a more thorough tutorial.

All Actions with `content` have access to this data:

```json5

{
    item: {
        kind: 'string', // the type of item (comment/submission)
        author: 'string', // name of the item author (reddit user)
        permalink: 'string', // a url to the item
        url: 'string', // if the item is a Submission then its URL (external for link type submission, reddit link for self-posts)
        title: 'string', // if the item is a Submission, then the title of the Submission,
        botLink: 'string' // a link to the bot's FAQ
    },
    rules: {
        // contains all rules that were run and are accessible using the name, lowercased, with all spaces/dashes/underscores removed
    }
}

```

The properties of `rules` are accessible using the name, lower-cased, with all spaces/dashes/underscores. If no name is given `kind` is used as `name` Example:

```

"rules": [
  {
    "name": "My Custom-Recent Activity Rule", // mycustomrecentactivityrule
    "kind": "recentActivity"
  },
  {
    // name = repeatsubmission
    "kind": "repeatActivity",
  }
]

```

**To see what data is available for individual Rules [consult the schema](#configuration) for each Rule.**

#### Quick Templating Tutorial

As a quick example for how you will most likely be using templating -- wrapping a variable in curly brackets, `{{variable}}`, will cause the variable value to be rendered instead of the brackets:

```

myVariable = 50;
myOtherVariable = "a text fragment"
template = "This is my template, the variable is {{myVariable}}, my other variable is {{myOtherVariable}}, and that's it!";

console.log(Mustache.render(template, {myVariable});
// will render...
"This is my template, the variable is 50, my other variable is a text fragment, and that's it!";

```

**Note: When accessing an object or its properties you must use dot notation**

```

const item = {
    aProperty: 'something',
    anotherObject: {
        bProperty: 'something else'
    }
}
const content = "My content will render the property {{item.aProperty}} like this, and another nested property {{item.anotherObject.bProperty}} like this."

```
